Welcome to my webpage! I am currently a NLP Data Scientist. I am focusing on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, and I worked with [Prof. Yongfeng Zhang](http://yongfeng.me/) and [Prof. Gerard de Melo](http://gerard.demelo.org/index.html#).\\
[Resume]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_YvS4Oyel2ecMTyolz1GKGR5OLhE86yl/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SmIAPy-wDFSG7H1snNGmqJtuWjkaPmpI/view?usp=drive_link))

I am mainly interested in two NLP/AI research questions:
  * **Exploring the Boundary of Large Language Models**: Currently and in the future, what capabilities might large language models (LLMs) possess? Is it possible for LLMs to develop creativity? What methods can be employed to enhance the creativity of LLMs and push boundaries of current knowledge frontiers? Generally, creativity can be conceptualized as existing at the far end of a fat-tail distribution, indicating that truly creative outputs are rare and overshadowed by a vast majority of conventional data, following _minority rules_ rather than _majority rules_. While smaller models are prone to overfitting, it's intriguing to consider whether LLMs, now or in the future, have the potential to identify and generate these infrequent yet profound creative instances?
  * **Exploring the Impacts of LLMs on Society**: Observing models using languages mirrors human language usage, raising questions about the profound impact these LLMs have on society. How might they change our language use? The intelligence of LLMs makes traditional measures like the Turing test and other mind tests outdated, significantly enhancing our work efficiency. However, it's notable how these models frequently generate generic, indistinguishable responses to varied specific questions. If social media platforms become saturated with such content, would it hasten or hinder deep meaningful contemplation?
